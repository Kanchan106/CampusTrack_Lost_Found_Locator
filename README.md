## 📘 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my internship experience to gain practical exposure to full-stack application development. 
As a first-time intern, I worked on designing, implementing, and integrating both frontend and backend components of a real-world system.
The Campus Lost and Found Locator aims to simplify the process of reporting and retrieving lost items by providing a centralized, user-friendly platform for campus users.

- Developed backend services using **Java** and **Spring Boot**, following RESTful API principles.
- Designed and integrated a **MySQL** database to manage users, item records, and chat data.
- Implemented **JWT-based authentication** and authorization using Spring Security.
- Integrated frontend and backend components and tested APIs using **Postman**.
- Learned proper project structuring, version control, and collaboration using **Git and GitHub**.
- Followed **Agile (Scrum)** practices to plan, develop, and iterate on project features.

This project strengthened my technical foundation and enhanced my confidence in building scalable web applications.
